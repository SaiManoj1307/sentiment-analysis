# Project Details for Resume / Portfolio

## Project Title
**OmniMind AI - Multimodal Emotion Recognition Engine**

## Tech Stack
*   **Languages**: Python, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
*   **AI/ML**: Hugging Face Transformers (RoBERTa), DeepFace (Computer Vision), TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV
*   **Backend**: Flask (REST API)
*   **Tools**: Git, GitHub Pages

## Description (Bullet Points)
*   Engineered a **Multimodal AI System** capable of detecting human emotions from both **Text** (NLP) and **Facial Expressions** (Computer Vision) in real-time.
*   **NLP Module**: Fine-tuned a **RoBERTa** transformer model to classify complex emotions (Joy, Anger, Sadness, Surprise) with high precision, surpassing traditional binary sentiment analysis.
*   **Vision Module**: Integrated **DeepFace** and **OpenCV** to analyze live webcam feeds and uploaded images, detecting facial emotions with bounding-box visualizations.
*   **Feature Integration**: Implemented a "Mood-to-Music" recommendation system that dynamically suggests **Spotify playlists** based on the user's detected emotional state.
*   **Frontend**: Designed a futuristic, responsive **Glassmorphism UI** with interactive tabs for seamless switching between text and vision modes.
*   **Performance**: Optimized model inference for low-latency real-time analysis on local CPUs.

## Short Summary (for Portfolio)
"A cutting-edge Multimodal AI application that fuses Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to decode human emotions. Features real-time webcam analysis, detailed emotion classification (e.g., Joy vs. Anger), and an intelligent music recommendation system linked to Spotify."
